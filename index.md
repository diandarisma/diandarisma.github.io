I am an Assistant Professor at Geophysical Engineering Department, University of Syiah Kuala, Indonesia. I finished my PhD at the Laboratory of Earth Resources Geomechanic, Tohoku University supervised by Prof. Yusuke Mukuhira. My PhD project focuses on induced seismicity that is triggered during injection. We want to extract fractures network based on microseismic clusters distribution.<br>
I am also interested in other geophysical methods, e.g., gravity, magnetic, and geoelectrical methods, to solve environmental issues and hazards. <br>
<br>
Current active project:<br>
1. Microseismic study at Muara Laboh geothermal field. <br>
2. Magnetotelluric study at Jaboi geothermal field. <br>
3. MASW and HVSR study at Aceh Besar region.
